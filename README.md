Designed a simple peer to peer application that has the following specifications -

- Read user input from a file
- parse the instructions and segregate them by type
- discover other nodes running the same application
- connect to required number of nodes ( here i used two nodes)
- communicate with nodes to perform task
- inform the user after task completion

To run this application, you need to open two terminals for the two peers (files) and run them.
